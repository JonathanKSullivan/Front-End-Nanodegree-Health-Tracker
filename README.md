# Front-End-Nanodegree-Health-Tracker
a single page app that tracks the user's calorie intake, and other health-related metrics powered by backbone.js. This is the fifth project in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program.

## Purpose
Using Backbone, I developed a single page app that tracks the user's calorie intake, and optionally, other health-related metrics. Typing food names into the search field will display a list of matching foods as provided by the health API. Users will be able to select an item from the list, and the item will be added to the list of foods the user is tracking. The total calorie count will also update to reflect the new daily total.
